:tada: We would like to share with you our open source projects, API's, libraries, open source design system, datasets etc. :tada:

Feel free to use them, but don't forget to check the licences used.

## Our philosophy 

It’s only been a couple years since we were a small, bootstrapped startup. 
Our job would have been immensely more difficult if it weren’t for the open source community and all the tools they provided for us. 
It’s only natural that we feel an urge to give back to the community, now that we can afford to help in more ways than just a commit here and there.

We give engineers the tools, data and support to become innovators.

## Kiwi.com Open Source

We’re open sourcing our internal tools and projects to support other developers.

Check them out on our [website](https://open.kiwi.com/open-source) or [GitHub organization](https://github.com/kiwicom).

## Open Datasets

Below, you can download all the available datasets: https://open.kiwi.com/open-datasets.

We recently started a new platform called `TEQUILA` where we allow partners who sign up to have a full access to all of our products, including our data.

Learn more about Tequila [here](https://partners.kiwi.com/presenting-tequila-revolution-travel-industry/) or check out the [website](https://tequila.kiwi.com) for more information. 

## Orbit: open source design system for your next travel project

Orbit is an open-source design system created for specific needs of Kiwi.com and together with that – for needs of travel projects.

We opened our design system to everyone. As a company, we believe that by giving people resources to create travel products easily, we all will make travel better. Together.

## Boilerplate for the Global Travel Hackathon

The purpose of [this repository](https://github.com/Global-Travel-Hackathon/travel-hack) is to provide a simple boilerplate for the [Global Travel Hackathon](https://hack.travel/) to be ready for coding!

It contains all necessary things to start building application upon `orbit-components` and `kiwicom-relay`, with help of `next.js`. All you have to do is to clone the repository and install the dependencies.
