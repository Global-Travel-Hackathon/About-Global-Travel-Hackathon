## Join us in making travel better

`by travellers, for travellers`

At Kiwi.com, we care. We love the world of travel, but we’re aware of its dark side. That’s why we’re inviting everyone to help us reshape the way we travel to make it smarter, sustainable and accessible for everyone.

Let’s celebrate World Tourism Day by attending and organising travel hackathons all over the globe on 27 September. We want to bring together engineers, designers, and innovators: providing them with a creative and supportive environment, and encouraging their ideas on how to hack travel.

We hope to trigger a global `#HackTravel` movement that would become a platform for constant improvement in the travel industry. 

## The main topics

:earth_africa: **Sustainability**

Do you have an idea on how to make travel more responsible? How to deal with mass tourism or how to support local economies?

:wheelchair: **Accessibility**

How can we make travel better for people with disabilities? How to find well-adapted hotel rooms, accessible restaurants or how to travel easier with musical instruments or bikes?

:speech_balloon: **Community**

People are getting more and more interested in authentic experiences that support local communities. Connect the unconnected and make tourism become a tool building online and offline communities.
